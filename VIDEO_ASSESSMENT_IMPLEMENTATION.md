# Video Assessment Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds assessment functionality to training videos. After a user watches a video (95% completion), they must complete an assessment with questions to unlock the "Mark Complete" button. The assessment requires a 70% passing score to proceed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints

#### New Controller Functions (`backend/controllers/AssessmentAndModule.js`)
- `getVideoAssessment(videoId)` - Retrieves assessment questions for a video
- `submitVideoAssessment(videoId, answers)` - Submits and validates assessment answers

#### New Routes (`backend/routes/AssessmentAndModule.js`)
- `GET /api/user/get/video-assessment/:videoId` - Get video assessment questions
- `POST /api/user/submit/video-assessment/:videoId` - Submit assessment answers

### 2. Frontend Components

#### New Components
- `VideoAssessmentModal.jsx` - Modal for displaying and handling assessments
- `VideoAssessmentModal.css` - Styling for the assessment modal

#### Updated Components
- `TrainingDashboard.jsx` - Integrated assessment functionality
- `TrainingDashboard.css` - Added assessment notice styles

### 3. API Integration (`lmsweb/src/api/api.js`)
- `getVideoAssessment(videoId)` - Get assessment questions
- `submitVideoAssessmentAnswers(videoId, answers)` - Submit assessment answers

## How It Works

### 1. Video Completion Flow
1. User watches video (must reach 95% completion)
2. System checks if video has assessment questions
3. If assessment exists, shows assessment modal
4. If no assessment, allows direct completion

### 2. Assessment Flow
1. Assessment modal loads questions from backend
2. User answers all questions (radio button selection)
3. System validates answers and calculates score
4. If score ≥ 70%, assessment passes and video completes
5. If score < 70%, user can retry assessment

### 3. Data Structure
Assessments are stored in the Module schema:
```javascript
{
  moduleName: "hr",
  videos: [
    {
      title: "v1",
      videoUri: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
      questions: [
        {
          questionText: "q1",
          options: ["a", "f", "f", "f"],
          correctAnswer: "a"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Endpoints

      "selectedAnswer": "a"
    }
  ],
  "userId": "68b2ecf4c8ad2931fc91b8b6",
  "trainingId": "68b1df271fc19fd7851c9fb4",
  "moduleId": "68b1df271fc19fd7851c9fb4"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Video assessment submitted successfully",
  "data": {
    "videoId": "68b1df271fc19fd7851c9fb5",
    "score": 100,
    "passed": true,
    "totalQuestions": 1,
    "correctAnswers": 1,
    "results": [
      {
        "questionId": "68b1df271fc19fd7851c9fb6",
        "selectedAnswer": "a",
        "correctAnswer": "a",
        "correct": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## User Interface

### Assessment Modal Features
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner while loading questions
- **Question Display**: Multiple choice questions with radio buttons
- **Validation**: Requires all questions to be answered
- **Results Display**: Shows score, pass/fail status, and correct answers
- **Retry Functionality**: Allows retaking failed assessments
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Video Player Integration
- **Assessment Notice**: Shows warning when video has assessment
- **Button Text**: Changes from "Mark Complete" to "Take Assessment"

## Security Features

### Backend Security
- **Question Sanitization**: Correct answers are not sent to frontend
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Score Calculation**: Server-side score calculation prevents cheating
- **Progress Tracking**: Assessment results saved to training progress

### Frontend Security
- **Answer Validation**: Client-side validation for complete answers
- **State Management**: Proper state handling for assessment flow

## Configuration

### Passing Threshold
- **Default**: 70% (configurable in backend)
- **Location**: `backend/controllers/AssessmentAndModule.js` line ~150

### Video Completion Threshold
- **Default**: 95% (configurable in frontend)
- **Location**: `lmsweb/src/components/TrainingDashboard.jsx` line ~400

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `cd lmsweb && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to training dashboard
4. Watch a video with assessment questions
5. Complete assessment and verify completion

### API Testing
Run the test script: `node test-video-assessment.js`

## Database Schema

### Module Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  moduleName: String,
  description: String,
  videos: [
    {
      _id: ObjectId,
      title: String,
      videoUri: String,
      questions: [
        {

          questionText: String,
          options: [String],
          correctAnswer: String
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Training Progress Collection
Assessment results are saved to the training progress:
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  trainingId: ObjectId,
  moduleId: ObjectId,
  videos: [
    {
      videoId: ObjectId,
      assessmentCompleted: Boolean,
      assessmentScore: Number,
      assessmentPassed: Boolean,
      assessmentAnswers: Array,
      completedAt: Date
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Question Types**: Support for different question types (multiple choice, true/false, etc.)
2. **Time Limits**: Add time limits for assessments
3. **Retry Limits**: Limit number of assessment retries
4. **Analytics**: Track assessment performance and analytics
5. **Randomization**: Randomize question order and option order
6. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk assessment creation

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching**: Cache assessment questions for better performance
2. **Pagination**: Support for large assessment sets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Assessment not loading**: Check video ID and module structure
2. **Score calculation errors**: Verify question structure in database
3. **Progress not saving**: Check user ID and training progress schema
4. **Modal not showing**: Verify video has questions array

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check database for correct question structure
4. Validate user permissions and authentication
